<p>Lizbeanism is all about following the teachings of the illustrious Liz Lemon: Head-writer for TGS w/ Tracy Jordan, Mentee of the esteemed Jack Donaghy , Author of the New York Times Best Seller <i>Deal Breakers</i> and all around kick-butt lady.

By following her example you will be able to tackle any and all issues in life head-on. You can find a unabridged version of her teachings <a href="http://www.30rockquotes.net/">here.</p>
<!-- The linked website is my example website I am looking to for comparison. Without looking at the code it is a very basic website, but most of it's flaws come from the color scheme rather than poor user design. Of the code itself, a lot of it is understandable to me, which I'm interpreting as meaning this is a very basically designed website. The semantics for sectioning of the website seems poor but they do manage to create a cooler website than I could manage so they must be doing something right.-->
